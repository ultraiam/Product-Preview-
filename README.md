## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- Bootstrap 5

### What I learned
It was a challenge getting everything spaced properly using bootstrap properties. I knew that bootstrap has a card component so thats what I used here. I had to read more documentation on how to space some of the bootstrap components, but I am still having trouble getting everything responsive when sizing down to smaller screens. I was going to use the media property but I think everything is working properly at the moment, so I dont want to mess it up. This took me a about 4 hours total over a couple days, so obiviously I am not at a profeciant level with this yet. I'll keep working and learning. 


### Useful resources

- https://getbootstrap.com/docs - This helped me use the card component and learn about spacing and responsiveness requirements to make this work.

## Acknowledgments

Using bootstrap for components like this made it really simple to get the layout done. I had to read some documentation because I wasn't entirely clear in the begining on how to get some of the components to work. I know I could've made it more responsive for mobile but the layout seems stable and I dont want to mess it up.
