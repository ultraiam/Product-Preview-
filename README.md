### What I learned
It was a challenge getting everything spaced properly using bootstrap properties. I knew that bootstrap has a card component so thats what I used here. I had to read more documentation on how to space some of the bootstrap components, but I am still having trouble getting everything responsive when sizing down to smaller screens. I was going to use the media property but I think everything is working properly at the moment, so I dont want to mess it up. This took me a about 4 hours total over a couple days, so obiviously I am not at a profeciant level with this yet. I'll keep working and learning. 


### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

## Acknowledgments

Using bootstrap for components like this made it really simple to get the layout done. I had to read some documentation because I wasn't entirely clear in the begining on how to get some of the components to work. I know I could've made it more responsive for mobile but the layout seems stable and I dont want to mess it up.
